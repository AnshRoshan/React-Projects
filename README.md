## Getting Started

To get started with any of the projects in this collection, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Node.js and pnpm

To run this project locally, you'll need to have Node.js and pnpm installed on your machine.

#### Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It's required to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser, including running scripts and building applications.

- **Installation:**

  - Visit the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
  - Download the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
  - Follow the installation instructions provided on the website.

- **Verification:**
  - After installation, open your terminal or command prompt.
  - Run the following command to verify that Node.js is installed:
    ```
    node -v
    ```
  - You should see the version number of Node.js printed in the terminal.

#### pnpm

pnpm is a fast, disk-space-efficient package manager for JavaScript projects. It's compatible with npm and yarn, but it optimizes the package installation process by using a single store for all dependencies.

- **Installation:**

  - After installing Node.js, open your terminal or command prompt.
  - Run the following command to install pnpm globally:
    ```
    npm install -g pnpm
    ```

- **Verification:**
  - After installation, run the following command to verify that pnpm is installed:
    ```
    pnpm -v
    ```
  - You should see the version number of pnpm printed in the terminal.

Once Node.js and pnpm are installed and verified, you're ready to set up and run the project locally.
